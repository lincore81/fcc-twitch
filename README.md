#About
This is my implementation of the "Use the twitch.tv JSON API" challenge on [free code camp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api). 

You can try it out here: https://lincore81.github.io/fcc-twitch

#Description
Users see a list of channels containing info such as channel names, followers,
whether they are live, what they are streaming etc. Channels can be added and
removed from the list. The list can be reordered via drag & drop.

#Install/Build
shell scripts are not exactly platform independent and you need python 2 for the server script, sorry for that (you can run your own, though).
`npm install` should be sufficient to satisfy all dependencies (except python, and npm-watch must be installed globally). Then do `npm run watch` or `npm run build`. It could work, but probably won't. Again, sorry.
