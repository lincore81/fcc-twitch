This is my implementation of the "Use the twitch.tv JSON API" challenge on
freecodecamp.com
(https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api). 

Users see a list of channels containing info such as channel names, followers,
whether they are live, what they are streaming etc. Channels can be added and
removed from the list.

I used react and es6. Please note that dist/js/react.js and
dist/js/react-dom.js are symlinks to node_modules, on windows you may have to
manually copy the libraries to dist/js.
